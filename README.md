Metastruct Experimental Standalone Testing Application
===

Here we test LÃ–VR, maybe Urho3D and/or godot and the like


### Development installation


 - Install VSCode
 - Get Lua Language Server: https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server
 - Get API Docs: https://gist.github.com/ussaohelcim/9eca6eaa903eefff07b4f3e2019de915 `git clone https://github.com/bjornbytes/lovr-docs.git`
 - Get LOVR https://lovr.org/downloads stable
 - `git clone https://github.com/Metastruct/mesta-src.git`
 - Copy sqlite3 to where lovr.exe is
 
You should have the following folder structure in the end:
 - mesta
   - mesta
     - README.md <- You are reading this readme
   - lovr
     - lovr.exe
     - sqlite3.dll
   - lovr-docs <- not required

### Features
 - Autoreload

### Structure
 - `addons/addon_name/init.lua` Addons folder for various additions, run code here, gets autoreloaded. May be shared between game engines?
 - `assets/` mounted as asset folder so you can use `models/test.obj` directly.
 - `src/lovr/extensions/` files shared between addons, autoloaded out of order
 - `src/lovr/libraries/` shared lua modules (DLL files need to be copied to lovr.exe directory!!!)

### Roadmap
Minimal walkable demo with something boring in it while figuring out a sane architecture for metastructistic chaotic systemacy of making whatever

### TODO
 - Desktop mode!
 - walking around in Desktop
 - walking around in VR
 - imgui integration
 - packaged version with github actions
 - To have a TODO/Roadmap
